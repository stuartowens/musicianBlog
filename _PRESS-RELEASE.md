There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
    MusicBlogger
## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Musicians that need to put their music up with blog posts to describe their influence or inspiration
## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  The MusicBlogger app allows the user to post their music from soundCloud onto the page alongside an image and a blog post. This allows their fans to see newly created work along with a story about their inspiration and a picture of the artist. It is a blog website for musicians and their fans. Ultimately musicians that are contributing are the only ones who need to login, and everyone else can view their work. The main page will show all users contributions but there will be a way to narrow it down to a single user.  
## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Musicians are writers and performers, but sometimes they write stories that go along with a song. Sometimes writers write stories that would be enhanced by music.
## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  This is a way for musicians to put their music to words or for them to put their words to music. It would also be good for writers that want to write stories or blog posts that want to put someone else's music to their words.
## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  Generating new ways to allow musicians to get creative
## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Simply signup and start creating and attaching your soundCloud sounds to your posts.
## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  I love how easy it is put my soundcloud sounds to music
## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  Go look at some of the posts that musicians have made.
